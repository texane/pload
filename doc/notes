Especially:
Isense = Vdac / Rsense

With:
Rsense = 0.05 Ohms

TEENSY3.1 DAC characterstics from MK20 datasheet:
https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/K20P64M72SF1.pdf
. 12 bits
. 100 pF max load capacitance
. 1 mA max current

TEENSY3.1 VREF characterstics from MK20 manual, ch. 34:
. 1.2 V trimmable at 0.5 mV steps

RELOAD2 amplifier documentation:
http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21733j.pdf
. 10^13 Ohms || 6 pF common mode input impedance
. 10^13 Ohms || 3 pF differential mode input impedance
Thus, DAC can drive it

If Vref is 1.2V, a 12 bits DAC voltage step is:
1.2 / 2^12 = 0.000293 mV
Which makes a current resolution of:
0.000293 / 0.05 = 0.006 A

Also, we want the maximum current not to exceed 3 A:
3 = Vdac / 0.05
Vdac = 3 * 0.05 = 0.15 V (512)

With the original RELOAD2 voltage divider, the maximum
voltage is 0.174 V


[ security ]

we want the maximum voltage not to exceed 0.15 V.
once the DAC is configured, we can ensure this by software.
